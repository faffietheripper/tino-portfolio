                  Having recently graduated from a full stack web development bootcamp my coding skills arent as advanced as the average experienced
                  software developer however as mentioned above, I plan on continuing to learn new programming languages so that I can be able to
                  create fluent and fashionable user experiences.

                  As far as React applications are concerned, I am equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently with
                  them to deliver fast and resilient solutions optimized for scale. As I grow as a developer, I hope to write clean, readable code
                  that can be used by others and leveraged to create beautiful softwares.
