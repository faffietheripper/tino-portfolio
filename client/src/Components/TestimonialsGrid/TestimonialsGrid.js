              message="I had the pleasure of being Tino's instructor on a coding bootcamp, and I cannot say enough positive things about him. Tino is not only highly motivated and eager to learn (which paid dividends in his coding skills) but also incredibly personable and easy to work with. His passion for coding and eagerness to learn new things is truly inspiring. The amount he's gone on to learn in his own time after the course is staggering, and is a testament to his work ethic. It was a pleasure teaching Tino, and I look forward to seeing him excel in his future endeavors."
